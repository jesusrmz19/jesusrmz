# jesusrmz website

This is a repo for my updated 2021 personal website.

## Overview

### Update

I'm learning how to integrate Sanity CMS for the content management of the project

### Why a new one?

I'm making the website a little bit more dynamic this time. It will be made with NextJS and it will host all customer projects, some side projects and experiments, as well as my blog. For which, I will implement Sanity CMS in order to create and publicate new posts
